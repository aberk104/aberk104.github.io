March and April 2020, New York & New Jersey were the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Between June and August 2020, the southern US became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. First Arizona in June 2020 then the southeastern US with Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia.

From September to November 2020, the northern US, especially North Dakota, became the new epicenter with some of the highest case rates per 100K over the entire time period.

December 2020 saw multiple states across the entirety of the US with high case rates.

January 2021 saw Arizona once again with the highest case rate, even higher than in June 2020.

Between February and April 2021, although the eastern United States had the highest case rates, the pandemic was not localized to these states. Various other states in the south, southwest, central, and northern US had similarly high case rates.

May and June 2021 saw much lower case rates per 100K across the US. Although certain states had higher rates than other states, the actual case rates were much lower compared to the height of the pandemic.

In July 2021, the Delta variant caused escalating case rates in the southern US, the same states that had high case rates between June and August 2020.
